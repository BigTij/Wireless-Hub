Simple program to show a list of devices wich
you can connect to using wireless protocols like
bluetooth or wifi.

List of things you can do with it:
- create your own protocol of communication through wifi
  in order to allow certain things to happen between
  connected devices.

- recreate a bluetooth protocol so that you can connect
  to multiple devices at the same time
  ex:
    - from phone to tv and sound bar
    - create a bluetooth router in order to make a more
      secure "network" of things thus decrease the amount
      of processing run by the hardware to make a faster
      connection
